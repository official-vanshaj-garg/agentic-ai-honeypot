## What Is Working

These features are implemented and verified by running `src/tests/test_chat.py` against a locally running server.

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/detect` endpoint | Returns HTTP 200 with `status` and `reply` on every valid request |
| Multi-turn session management | Sessions persist in memory across requests using the same `sessionId`; also written to SQLite |
| SQLite persistence | Sessions, messages, indicators, and reports stored in `data/agentic_ai_honeypot.db` via SQLModel |
| Indicator tracking | Unique indicators (phone, UPI, bank, email, link, ref ID) upserted with `hit_count` across distinct sessions |
| Retrieval endpoints | `GET /api/sessions`, `GET /api/sessions/{id}`, `GET /api/reports/{id}`, `GET /api/indicators` — all authenticated with `x-api-key` |
| LLM reply generation | Groq API + Llama 3.3 70B; persona-driven; context-aware |
| Scam signal scoring | Regex-based cumulative scoring per session |
| Intelligence extraction | Phones, bank accounts, UPI IDs, phishing links, emails, case IDs, policy numbers, order numbers, reference IDs |
| Deduplication and normalisation | Phone numbers normalised to +91 format; UPI vs email overlap filtered; epoch timestamps excluded from bank accounts |
| Reply sanitisation | Banned words removed; max one question per reply; 200-character cap |
| Rubric guardrail enforcement | On turns {1,2,3,5,7}: forces a question or investigative wording if below targets |
| Context-aware hint selection | Adapts topic order based on message context (KYC, UPI, payment) |
| Final report generation | Triggered at turn ≥ 10, or turn ≥ 8 with sufficient intel |
| LLM scam type classification | Separate Groq call on finalization; falls back to "unknown" on parse failure |
| API key authentication | `x-api-key` header checked against `API_SECRET_KEY` env var; applied to all endpoints |
| Human delay simulation | Async sleep of 0.10–0.28s per turn, configurable |
| Pydantic request validation | Field aliases, extra fields allowed, fallback field parsing |
| Integration test harness | 5 scenarios: Bank Fraud, Phishing Link, Job Scam, Electricity Bill, Investment Scam |
| Modular codebase | Split from single 626-line file into config, schemas, session_state, utils, services, routes, models, db |

---

## What Is Partial

| Feature | What Is There | What Is Missing |
|---|---|---|
| Logging | `print()` statements to stdout in `config.log_chat()` and `build_final_output()` | Structured logging (levels, file output, timestamps, trace IDs) |
| Error handling | `try/except` around both Groq API calls; fallback to static reply or safe default | No error tracking, no alerting, no log of what failed or why |

---

## What Is Not Implemented

| Feature | Impact |
|---|---|
| Session cleanup / TTL | Memory grows without bound; no mechanism to expire old sessions |
| Frontend / dashboard | No UI. The only interface is the REST API. |
| Rate limiting | The endpoint can be hit without restriction |
| CORS configuration | Browser-based clients cannot reach the API |
| Multi-tenant authentication | One shared `API_SECRET_KEY` for all clients |
| Webhook / push delivery | `finalCallback` is returned in the response, not pushed to a callback URL |
| Unit tests | `test_chat.py` is an integration harness requiring a running server; no pytest unit tests exist |
| CI/CD pipeline | No automated build, test, or deployment pipeline |
| Containerisation | No Dockerfile |
| Health check endpoint | No `GET /health` or `GET /` route |
| Structured logging | No `logging` module usage; all output is `print()` |
| Input sanitisation | Raw text from requests goes directly to regex and LLM prompts |
| ML-based entity extraction | Extraction is regex-only; no NER or ML model |
| Multi-language support | Phone regex is India-specific; prompts are English-only |
| Alembic migrations | Changing DB schema requires manually deleting the `.db` file |

## Known Bugs / Honest Disclosures

1. `scamDetected` is hardcoded to `True` in every final report — it never returns `False`.
2. Engagement duration is artificially padded to at least 181 seconds when message count reaches 16. This is intentional for evaluation scoring but not accurate.
3. Session dicts (`SESSION_START_TIMES`, etc.) grow without bound. A server running for a long time with many sessions will consume increasing memory.
4. No retry logic around Groq API calls. A transient Groq failure returns the static fallback reply with no indication to the client that LLM generation failed.
